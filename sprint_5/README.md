# Proyecto 5 - TripleTen 
I was working as an analyst for Megalinee, a telecom operator that offers its clients two prepaid plans: 
**Surf** and **Ultimate**. The commercial deparment wants to determine which plan generates more revenue to better allocate the advertising budget. 

The task was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the tariffs baes on data from **500 Megaline clients**: who they are, where they are from, which tariff they use, and the number of calls, SMS, and internet data hey consumed during 2018. The objetive was to analyze customer behavior and identify which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. Statistical hypothesis testing was used to answer this question. 

## Project tasks

1. **Data preparation** 
- Convert columns into appropiate data types. 
- Detect and correct data errors, documenting the process.
- For each user, calculate monthly totals for: 
	- Number of calls and minutes used. 
	- Number of SMS sent. 
	- Internet data volume. 
	- Monthly revenue (based on plan limits, average charges, and monthly fee).

2. **Data analysis**

- Analyze customer behavior across both tariffs. 
- Calculate descriptive statistics: mean, variance, standard deviation. 
- Plot histograms and describe distributions. 

3. **Hypothesis testing** 

- Test wheter the average revenue from the Ultimate and Surf plans differs. 
- Test whether the average from users in the NY - NJ regions differs from other regions. 
- Define null and alternative hypotheses, select an appropiate significance level, and explain the chosen testing method. 

4. **Conclusions** 

- Summarize findings on customer behavior. 
- Recommend which plan is more profitable for Megaline.
